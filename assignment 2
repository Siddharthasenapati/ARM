IT is the if-then instruction ,its purpose is to check condition after IT specified and execute the instructions following it based upon the condition.

ITTE instruction ,It is the ARM's IF-THEN-ELSE instruction, which was introduced in the Thumb-2 instruction set.

This instruction is used for handling small sequences of conditional code, up to 4 instructions.And also these four instructions must have specified its conditional part of thier syntax,Making them conditional instructions.These conditions can be logically same or inverse. 

In the erroneous code :

ITTTE LT
MOV R3

We can see here the instruction here following IT is not conditional compared to 

ITTTE LT
ADDLT
MOVLT
MOVLT
SUBGE
where all the instructions after IT are conditional in execution.

This is the reason we got errors in above mentioned code
