__Design of SoC using Cortex M0__   
In this project, we build a basic SoC platform. Work includes:  
_Hardware implementation:_        
      --Implement the hardware framework that has been written in Verilog.  
      --Prototype the SoC framework onto an FPGA.  
_Software programming:_  
      --Programed the Cortex-M0 processor using assembly language.  
      --Simulate the program using Keil Î¼Vision Simulator.  
_Purpose:_  
     --Toggle the 8-bit LEDs at a given frequency  
     --Analyze the behavior of the AHB bus using an on-chip hardware debugging tool.
